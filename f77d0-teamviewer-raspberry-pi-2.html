Hi! I'm new to this Linux and to the rest of stuff so please be kind. Know little about me- I'm more as windows IT (like 3 years as IT salesman and enthusiast and last 7 months as IT assistant). TL:DR at the bottom. We have a server with local HDD (all the files are located there) which could be accessed only through LAN cable (have wifi but doesn't have access to server) have firewall Fortigate 80C (most probably will upgrade to 80E if that makes any difference). Of course all the computers. Заказ от инженера Птибурдукова Петра: 1) 260 руб = 2 шт = Arduino DigiSpark в USB по 130 руб. 2) 180 руб = 1 шт = Arduino NANO по 160 руб. 
I'd like to build pihole appliances for my family members. I'd like to buy "pi" devices that are as cost effective as possible. e.g. raspberry, orange, banana, etc. It needs enough ram/cpu to run a desktop environment so I can load and run AnyDesk/Teamviewer for remote access. I'd like 1Gb on the device, but I assume 100Mb would be sufficient for DNS. Depending on the manufacture of the pi, I could run raspbian, armbian or others. What would be the lightest desktop to install? BTW.I'm. We would like to have jukebox type music-player in our office that anyone can play. We already have speakers and Raspberry Pi. Some of us do have a Spotify Premium accounts that we can use with that jukebox. We briefly tried Volumio but that has some problems (power outage usually kills the memory card, and sometimes the playback just freezes and it starts to play the same song over and over again). Then there is RuneAudio but that does not support Spotify I already have: Raspberry Pi Zero W and Class 10 microSD Card With Raspbian - 16GB. Which I can ship to you. You set it up with Pi-Hole make sure it works and send it back to me with including or pointing to detailed instructions on how to use it. How much? Edit: Or you can send me a working one. And I will pay for hardware, work and shipping. Edit 2: I did try to set it up before, but had issues. Here is my last effort to set it up: https://old.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/8gh7r9/got_raspbe. 
Hy, So i bought a Raspberry pi 3 B+ to use as a download-/twitchdrop-farm -box. First i installed teamviewer on it and at this point it already was pretty laggy with rendering errors all over the place, Example: https://imgur.com/6D5NZx7 (https://imgur.com/6D5NZx7) All i did was to press F11 to go fullscreen and F11 to go back windowed. and the taskbar at the top still shows the content of the browser window. Parts of it go away as soon as they refresh, for example the clock. I used to have WakeOnLan for teamviewer that worked great. I had a RaspberryPi as my secondary network device with Teamviewer on it (via wifi / main computer was wired lan). That RaspberryPi is no longer, but I want to get WOL working again. I have an old android phone with Teamviewer on it however it doesn't seem to work (It is assigned to my account and all other steps completed). Is there a way to use an android phone as your secondary network device I want to be able to remotely access a number of machines with ssh at any time. I've installed Ubuntu on a few machines, and I'd like to be able to help people when I can. Linux is amazing for computer helpdesk stuff because you can instantly access with ssh, instead of guiding someone through installing Teamviewer, then pissing about on their machine for half an hour. Plan A Set up port forwarding, keep the user's password, remote access at any time. Problem - port forwarding My computer is connected to the router over WiFi. My computer is in sleep during the day to save power. Sometimes I need to remote connect with VNC or TeamViewer to get a file, but that's impossible when my computer is asleep. My theory is- if you can use a mouse/keyboard connected through USB to physically wake the computer, surely there is some device that connects through USB and has its independent connection to the router over WiFi, and can mimic a click/keystroke through Hi, There is my homelab ! https://i.imgur.com/WWIPijX.jpg (https://i.imgur.com/WWIPijX.jpg) Startech 12U 4 Post Rack Unifi US\-16 Switch Synology DS1817\+ / 5 WD Red 6To / SHR\-2 \- SMB shares for everything, NFS only for vSphere Dell Poweredge T440 / Intel Xeon Silver 4110 / 128 Go RDIMM / Samsung EVO PRO SSD 500Go x 3 / Dell Perc H330 Raid 0 DNS01 : piHole / Cloudflare / DOH DHCP / DNS / DC : Windows 2016 Veeam B&R : Win 2016 Certificate server. 
Hello friends. I am giving my detailed first impressions of the T430s (https://imgur.com/a/FEvow) in case it helps another keyboard nut like myself choose his next laptop. ## Specs: All stock in excellent condition i7-3520M NVidia NVS 5200M (1gb VRAM) 2 x 4gb RAM 2.5" 7mm 180gb Intel SSD 520 Back-lit keyboard Webcam Fingerprint reader Pretty much a max-spec unit other than missing WWAN and Smart Card reader. eBay price: 0, with next-day local pickup Hi Guys hoping for a little help if possible. I'm trying to get a NAS server to WOL from the packet being sent from a raspberry Pi that I am remoting into using teamviewer. I have checked that all the settings in the BIOS and the Network settings are set to accept magic packets and all that. My hope is to use the teamviewer WOL command but when that failed I tried using several other methods to send the command from the Pi. Im using a Pi 3 Model B as the WoL server Moonlight is the coolest thing I've ever experienced. It's like Teamviewer or Remote Desktop, only the performance is 100x better because of the GPU acceleration. It's so good that I can just remote into my PC with the Moonlight app on my phone, and tell VLC to start playing a movie, and the movie gets streamed to my phone perfectly, 30fps, in-sync audio. And I don't mean it fetches the movie then decodes on my phone like a normal app would do. I mean it streams the entire desktop Hello I am following the steps on the following link https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-video-looper/installation (https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-video-looper/installation) TO build a video lupping all is working but when I install teamviewer if the program is on i get a black screen and I am not able to disable the program with esc as I do on the rasberri pi  Do you know what is happening. Going out of town for a couple weeks and want to retain complete control over my 2 6x GPU rigs. Just wondering what programs/hardware I can use to do so. For simplicity's sake I'll be running NiceHash and Windows 10 on each rig and have it set up to email me if either rig stops mining for more than 5 minutes, and it also displays temps in a convenient fasion. I do have TeamViewer on each of the rigs, but that doesn't help much in the event of a complete crash where everything locks up, which. tl;dr: Setup Raspberry Pi to boot Lubuntu from HDD, enlarge EX4 Root Partition to use full capacity of HDD, install and run Bitcoin Core for Linux. Yesterday I posted some pics and a basic outline of a Raspberry Pi Bitcoin full node I made and lots of people were wondering how I set it up. I AM NOT IN ANY WAY OR SHAPE KNOWLEDGE IN LINUX, I JUST TINKER A LOT AND THERE ARE MUCH SMARTER PEOPLE IN THIS SUBJECT THAN ME . With that out of the way, I wrote up a basic guide This is my current setup, I have opened port 22 on the router to the server's port 22, and I use this for ssh access. Pic (https://imgur.com/YTwuvw2) The problem is the server also has other services, like transmission, syncthing, and resilio sync. I have read that opening up multiple ports on the router is a security risk, so I want to avoid that (https://imgur.com/3kvRjRU)(Pic). Currently, I turn on another PC in that network, connect to it using teamviewer, then inside a browser 
Hello everyone, As the title says, I'd like to control a PC (linked to my TV setup) with my Raspberry PI. I already tried Remmina but the problem is that it locks the session and the pc does not display anything on the TV when connected. I'd like something like teamviewer but local and if possible that does not disconnect (or easy to connect). The best would be to have everything over wifi if possible. I mean, that's got to exist, right? It looks like most firewall devices that allow VPN want at least one end to have a static IP. What I'm looking for is something for machine automation- I want to be able to set up a device (firewall, NAT, whatever) that can bridge a public WAN (which may or may not have dynamic IPs) to a local LAN (that will always have the same static IP). I would use my laptop (from home, work, or a hotel) to log in to the VPN and access all of the machinery Pics: https://imgur.com/a/6BV5v Hope I didn't bring pests home. A bit worried bringing home a plant from Home Depot but I wanted to give some sort of veggie a shot. Also got my raspberry Pi camera mounted correctly inside the tent after a couple weeks of it just being taped inside. I can use teamviewer to access the stream and weather station from my phone anywhere! Big thanks to mcgrowerr for the help getting this set up. This all makes me so fucking happy I could. 
As the title says, been having this issue a lot, especially today. I mine with ethermine.org and run a 6x 580 rig on windows 10. My rig runs wifi but is mere feet from the router. It's on the other side of the living room so I don't want to have to run cable (fiancee wouldn't be too happy with that). My rig only runs for a few hours. I tried changing the server to us2 and that seems to be more stable, but I'm still monitoring it. NOW - I do a side project called storjshare which requires. Wondering what is going on here. I have a raspberry pi loaded with the arm friendly of teamviewer. When I check it: teamviewer daemon status it says it is running. I've restarted the vpn several times. I've killed all teamviewer processes, stopped the daemon, started again. You name it. But, I have yet the opportunity to so much as enter the password before it rejects my authentication. Praytell, how is it rejecting my authentication when I haven't passed it anything to authenticate? COMPLETED Paypal as soon as job is done. Teamviewer will be used to control a fresh install on my new raspberry. Hi! I'm 18 and I have lived in the US for all my life, but currently I'm studying abroad. I was thinking about registering in mTurk using a raspberry pi as a VPN server or using TeamViewer from a pc in the US. Is that possible? I have ssn, address, zip code and everything. Thanks. I am trying to configure TeamViewer to do Wake on LAN over the internet. By using both my phone and another computer on the same LAN I am able to confirm that WOL works locally. I changed the device settings, BIOS settings, etc. and everything works fine. So I am ruling out the issues of a device configuration issue. TeamViewer is configured to use a domain name that I have registered on dyndns.org and I have set up my router to use DynDNS as well. For another device on the network (Raspber. Let me start by saying that I LOVE THE PI-HOLE SERVER! Now, I'd like to add one to my dad's house, BUT he is on Comcast Xfinity and only using their provided WiFi Router/Gateway (I ain't calling it a modem). Now the Xfinity setup doesn't allow you to setup different DNS servers, and I'm not sure if it would allow me to use a different DHCP server. Let's assume I can't change the router to use a different DHCP server. Am I stuck at this point and I wouldn't be able to add a Pi-hole.
